<h1>Satellites 101</h1>

Satellites 101 is an independent eductional website with the core goal of getting people interested in Space and Satellites. Satellites are crucial for so many of our daily tasks that it is a shame that so few resources are availible. The website was designed to be as interactive and enjoyable as possible. This project was intended to be a starting point for people wanting to learn more about space. With lots of links and additional information, they can explore what ever direction interests them.

<h2>Creation process</h2>


I started with my target audience being school children. Possibly this website would have been first used as information for an essay or school project then it would have shown them how interesting the space sector can be and how exciting the opportunites were. This gave me the website profile below.

users: school pupils writing essays on space
problem: need info on satellites to write essays
uniqueness: easy to understand and interactive making learning fun
website description: One stop shop for credible reliable but also easy to inderstand information on satellites. an informative interactive edjutainment website aimed at young pupils interested in space covering the current usage, history andhow to get involved.

Using the website description I generated 10/20 personas to see what adjacent wants I could incorporate into the website. These are just a few:

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/user-persona%20(7).png?raw=true)

This made me broaden my approach and think solely about features and what i want to include in my website. This features list included:
 News & Current affairs
 Careers information and how to get into the industry
 Educational groups or societies/ a way to meet up with other space enthusiasts
 Starter information on how satellites work form square one (emphasis on possible teaching resouce)
 Expert information, nitty gritty on knowledge someone would need to make a satellite
 History of satellites
 CubeSats and their current usage
 "Awesomeness of space" (page just dedicated to showing how cool space can be
 Overfiew of the field and different subsetions of it for employment
 satellites in fiction compared to reality

As you can see this was way too many features to add to my website so i refined it down to 4 main sections
 Home page
  With some news, some interactive/fun learning and nav links
 SatPhys
  The basics of how the physics works with satellites
 Early Sats
  Explaining historical context of the space race and satellites, Showing examples of early satellites and how different they can look
 SatEng
  an overview of the lifecycle of a satellite

This pushed my site back towards the original direction. Aimed mainly at young people or people wanting to learn more. I had to drop the careers/industry aspect completely as it just didnt fit my target audience.

After the content overhaul I ended with this website profile.
 users: people from none science background/ young people
 problem: want to learn about satellites but dont have the prerequisite knowledge needed for the main avenues of education on the topic 
 uniqueness: easy to understand and interactive making learning fun
 website description: Begginer platform aimed at nurturing interest and excitement for the field of satellites and guiding users to high-quality additional resources for further research. Starting with a 2 pronged approach of teaching the basic science behind how they work and the preliminary engineering processes. 
 website meta description: a begginer friendly launch site to blast off into the world of satellites and space science.

Now knowing what content I wanted on the site I produced multiple iterations of wireframe. initially it looked unprofessional so i checked other websites on dribbble to make it more sophisticated This was the final itteration:






<h2>Colour scheme</h2>

the colour scheme chosen was trying to motivate feelings of professionalism and confidence in the information without being dull and boring. The choice of blue was settled on for this purpose.

<h3>First time visitor</h3>
 the user can click on or interact with anything that interests them. with the sections being independent there is no order that they must be interacted with and the links below the hero serve to guide the user based on what questions they want answered. Minimising content the user doesnt find interesting.
 There are extra links in the footer if the user decides they want more resources (clearly labelled).

<h3>Frequent Visitor</h3>
 the nav links at the top serve as faster access throughout the site and frequent visitors can navigate to the specific content they need as it is labelled.

<h2>Page features</h2>

<h3>Nav bar</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/nav-open.PNG?raw=true)
![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/nav-closed.PNG?raw=true)

this is consistent along all pages but the nav-links change to a burger bar which when clicked (shown in 2nd img) expands vertically for mobile views.

<h3>Hero img</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/hero-img.PNG?raw=true)

centered with quiz and news on big screens or taking up the full width on small ones

<h3>Quiz</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/quiz.PNG?raw=true)

engaging quiz to get people involved and interacting with the website instead of just reading walls of text

<h3>News</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/news.PNG?raw=true)

an aside for people who want to keep up with current affairs

<h3>Accordion</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/accordion.PNG?raw=true)

used to display alot of information in a less intimidating way with links throughout to other sources of information

<h3>Timeline</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/timeline.PNG?raw=true)

Interactive with pop overs for more detailed information or but still an infographic if youre less intriqued by dates so dont interact with it.

<h3>Carousel</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/carousel.PNG?raw=true)

aimed at being more interactive display and the inherently circular nature of carousels embodies the cycle aspect of the life cycle.

<h3>Footer</h3>

![alt text](https://github.com/JakCrane/Assignment-1/blob/main/doc/footer.PNG?raw=true)

relatively standard footer to not overwhelm. it contains a way to interact with the organisation and links to additional resources that may be useful to people after they finish with the page.

<h2>Future work</h2>

given more time I would go over the carousel and make not change sizes when changing pages. I tried to do this but it ended up with lots of empty space or words being obscured as they overflowed the divs. additionally the timeline is interactive but you cannot tell. i would like to add a none intrusive popup that just tells people they can click the buttons for additional information
