ss of finished product in readme
	Write a README.md file for the web application that explains its purpose, the value that it provides to its users, and the deployment procedure.
	Insert screenshots of the project features, give a brief description of what each feature does and explain its value to the user.
  Attribute all code from external sources to its original source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.
  Organise HTML and CSS code into well-defined and commented sections
  Use consistent and effective markdown formatting to produce a README file in English that is well-structured, easy to follow, and has few grammatical errors.


Satellites 101 is an independent eductional website with the core goal of getting people interested in Space and Satellites. Satellites are crucial for so many of our daily tasks that it is a shame that so few resources are availible. The website was designed to be as interactive and enjoyable as possible. This project was intended to be a starting point for people wanting to learn more about space. With lots of links and additional information they can explore what ever direction interests them. 


Creation process

I started with my target audience being school children. Possibly this website would have been first used as information for an essay or school project then it would have shown them how interesting the space sector can be and how exciting the opportunites were. This gave me the website profile below.

 users: school pupils writing essays on space
 problem: need info on satellites to write essays
 uniqueness: easy to understand and interactive making learning fun
 website description: One stop shop for credible reliable but also easy to inderstand information on satellites. an informative interactive edjutainment website aimed at young pupils interested in space covering the current usage, history andhow to get involved.

Using the website description I generated 10/20 personas to see what adjacent wants I could incorporate into the website. These are just a few:

This made me broaden my approach and think solely about features and what i want to include in my website. This features list included:
 News & Current affairs
 Careers information and how to get into the industry
 Educational groups or societies/ a way to meet up with other space enthusiasts
 Starter information on how satellites work form square one (emphasis on possible teaching resouce)
 Expert information, nitty gritty on knowledge someone would need to make a satellite
 History of satellites
 CubeSats and their current usage
 "Awesomeness of space" (page just dedicated to showing how cool space can be
 Overfiew of the field and different subsetions of it for employment
 satellites in fiction compared to reality

As you can see this was way too many features to add to my website so i refined it down to 4 main sections 
 Home page
  With some news, some interactive/fun learning and nav links
 SatPhys
  The basics of how the physics works with satellites
 Early Sats
  Explaining historical context of the space race and satellites, Showing examples of early satellites and how different they can look
 SatEng
  an overview of the lifecycle of a satellite

This pushed my site back towards the original direction. Aimed mainly at young people or people wanting to learn more. I had to drop the careers/industry aspect completely as it just didnt fit my target audience.

After the content overhaul I ended with this website profile.
 users: people from none science background/ young people
 problem: want to learn about satellites but dont have the prerequisite knowledge needed for the main avenues of education on the topic 
 uniqueness: easy to understand and interactive making learning fun
 website description: Begginer platform aimed at nurturing interest and excitement for the field of satellites and guiding users to high-quality additional resources for further research. Starting with a 2 pronged approach of teaching the basic science behind how they work and the preliminary engineering processes.
