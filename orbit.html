                                            that attracts two objects towards each other.
                                            The strength of gravity depends on the mass of the object (how heavy they
                                            are) and the distance between them. The more massive an object is, the

                                            The farther apart two objects are, the weaker the gravity between them is.
                                            The most familiar example of gravity is the force that pulls objects towards
                                            the center of the Earth, which is what keeps us on the ground and what makes

                                            over other scientists of the era. This advantage keplar leveraged to
                                            disprove the geocentric model of the planets and really shake up the
                                            scientific community.
                                            The geocentric model can be seen on the right and while it looks like
                                            nonsense to us today it was accepted as truth until the 17th century.

                                            The first law, (the law of orbits) states that shape of an orbit is an
                                            elipse with the sun at one of the two foci.

                                            The second law, (law of areas) is shown on the right and states that a line
                                            connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This
                                            means that a planet moves faster when it is closer to the sun and slower
                                            when it is farther away.

                                            The third law, (harmonic law) states that the further from a body you orbit
                                            the slower your speed must be.

                                            elipse with the sun at one of the two foci.

                                            The second law, (law of areas) is shown on the right and states that a line
                                            connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This
                                            means that a planet moves faster when it is closer to the sun and slower
                                            when it is farther away.

                                            The third law, (harmonic law) states that the further from a body you orbit
                                            the slower your speed must be.
