                                        it is worth. Once everything is collected in one room the assembly stage
                                        begins. This is done in a clean room to prevent contamination like
                                        dirt/dust from ruining the design. Then various components and
                                        subsystems of the satellite are put together. This includes assembling
                                        the structure of the satellite, such as the frame or platform that holds
                                        all the subsystems in place, as well as attaching the power, propulsion,
                                        communications, and scientific instruments. This stage also includes

                                    <p class="header-color">The design stage is further split into 2
                                        phases. The preliminary design phase and the critical design

                                    <p class="header-color">The PDP is focused entirely around a problem to
                                        fix or a data set to collect. Lots of research and investigation
                                        occurs in this phase as they have alot of questions to answer if
                                        they want to pitch the idea successfully to recieve the funding.
                                        The questions they seek to answer include: if the goal of the
                                        project is feasible, what constraints exist for the project, if
                                        this is the best solution to acheive the goal and what are the
                                        associated risks or uncertainties with the project. At the end
                                        of the first phase there should be a rough idea of how much it
                                        will cost, how long it will take, how effective it is and what
                                        size or shape the satellite will be. Once all these questions
                                        have been answered they will be pitched to funding organisations
                                        and if successful the project will move onto the critical design
                                        phase. It is common for the PDP to be itterative as noone starts
                                        with a perfect idea first try.

                                        is ideal the focus turns to making it work in practice. The CDP
                                        is where exact plans and designs are drafted up. Everything is
