                                        fix or a data set to collect. Lots of research and investigation
                                        occurs in this phase as they have alot of questions to answer if
                                        they want to pitch the idea successfully to recieve the funding.
                                        The questions they seek to answer include: if the goal of the
                                        project is feasible, what constraints exist for the project, if
                                        this is the best solution to acheive the goal and what are the
                                        associated risks or uncertainties with the project. At the end
                                        of the first phase there should be a rough idea of how much it
                                        will cost, how long it will take, how effective it is and what
                                        size or shape the satellite will be. Once all these questions
                                        have been answered they will be pitched to funding organisations
                                        and if successful the project will move onto the critical design
                                        phase. It is common for the PDP to be itterative as noone starts
                                        with a perfect idea first try.

                                        is ideal the focus turns to making it work in practice. The CDP
                                        is where exact plans and designs are drafted up. Everything is
                                        specified exactly how it will work and often prototypes are
                                        produced to test the critical parts of the design for flaws. The
                                        exact mass calculations, power consumption and interfacing
                                        between subsystems is also clarified. From the critical design,
                                        two seperate people building the designs should produce
                                        identical end products. often a prototype will be tested in
                                        simulated space environments.

                                        external companies as making them in house is usually more effort than
                                        it is worth. Once everything is collected in one room the assembly stage
                                        begins. This is done in a clean room to prevent contamination like
                                        dirt/dust from ruining the design. Then various components and
                                        subsystems of the satellite are put together. This includes assembling
                                        the structure of the satellite, such as the frame or platform that holds
                                        all the subsystems in place, as well as attaching the power, propulsion,
                                        communications, and scientific instruments. This stage also includes
                                        installing and testing the software and electronic systems that control
                                        the satellite's functions.

                                        These launch vehicles are often rockets taking up many different payloads and involve multiple stages, each with 
                                        their own engines and fuel tanks. These vehicles progressively increase the satellites altitude and vertical velocity until
                                        they are ready to release the satellites. The satellite is typically attached to the top of the launch vehicle, and 
                                        protected by a fairing during the early stages of ascent to protect it from destructive G forces. The 
                                        rocket is typically launched from a launch pad, and the trajectory is carefully controlled to ensure that the satellite
                                        is inserted into the desired orbit. The launch is controlled from a mission control center, where a team of engineers and
                                        technicians monitor the progress of the launch and make adjustments as needed.

                                        in the mission's design phase. The satellite control center usually sends commands to the satellite via radio waves and tells the payload
